# SMS Classifier

This project implements a simple SMS Classifier that utilizes the power of NumPy and Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis. The goal of the classifier is to categorize SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The dataset consists of labeled SMS messages, and the model is built using classical machine learning techniques.

## About

The SMS Classifier is designed to showcase the effectiveness of using NumPy and Pandas for handling and processing data, making it a scalable and versatile solution for classification tasks. The classification model is trained on a dataset containing a collection of SMS messages, labeled as spam or ham. The project emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation.

## Key Features

- Efficient data manipulation with NumPy and Pandas.
